# Data Analysis of Magic the Gathering Cards.
This will contain the dataset of the standard cards (last year's standard) that could have been played in the format.
Please make sure that you have the most current version of python and include the following:
```
pip install pandas
pip install jupyterlab
pip install matplotlib
```

The information that you will find in the magic jupyter notebook will be about each color's power distribution.
A question we asked was "Are there more green creatures with higher powers then the creatures of other colors?"
From the data provided we can see the power distribution for all of the colors given in the data.

We can also formulate other questions as well, such as "What is the relation between power and toughness?",
"which color has more sorcery/instance spells?", "which color has the most creatures?".
